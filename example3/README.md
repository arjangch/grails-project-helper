# Example 3
This example uses Spring Security plugins Core, Core UI and REST.

# Create REST API
In this example we want to work with data in Json or Xml format. There are many ways of doing this 
- We can output domain as JSON or XML. This will output all fields
- We can render some fields as JSON or XML. 
- We can POST new data into our app.
